- using an abstraction like that will only help at first, they are going to have to learn the platform regardless so rather than learn one toolkit/SDK, they're going to have to learn 2

- millions of dependencies. I spent my time tracing down cryptic errors, old stale github issues ect ect

-  It makes no business sense to throw away something that is "working" just to replace it with something else at massive cost.

- you’re betting your entire app on a third party company that is under no obligation to do anything for you ever?

- And when something is released by Apple that’s not compatible with your third party solution you’re stuck until its fixed

- And then there’s the risk that there’s no good way to expose whatever obscure API you might want to use in the future to your hybrid shell

- Another consideration I would take into account is how much time you have to wait for vendors to update. I worked at a place where we ran into some trouble because a thing in Titanum was broken on iOS 11 and didn’t get fixed by them until Apple shipped 11.1. That was no fun

- What's to stop Google from sunsetting the framework quickly as opposed to keeping it alive for at least 3 years?

- Google and Apple aren't great friends. What "if" Apple pulls a fast one?
